/**
 * The Percivalian Way — The Seven Pillars.
 *
 * A patient-facing, self-analysis arc that moves through the three Lacanian
 * registers (Imaginary, Symbolic, Real), the Freudian mechanisms of repetition
 * and drive, and a Jungian archetypal descent, closing on integration.
 *
 * NOTE on framing: the "nigromancy codex" is aesthetic only. All exercise
 * content is grounded psychological work — no supernatural claims, no mysticism
 * presented as literal reality. "Obsidian nature" = the shadow aspects of
 * personality, cognition, and behavior (a metaphor, not a metaphysics).
